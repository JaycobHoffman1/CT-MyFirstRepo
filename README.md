# My Coding Temple Journey (so far)
- First, I learned about basic computer literacy skills (memory, operating systems, navigating Windows File Explorer, etc.)
- Next, I learned about the software development process, as well as creating flowcharts to visualize ideas for upcoming projects.
- Then, I learned about my computer's CLI and how to use Terminal to create, manipulate, and manage files.
- I am now learning about GitHub and its usefulness in collaborative projects!
### I love Coding Temple! :smile:
